# CERN Robotic Framework - C++

The CERN Robotic Framework follows a modular architecture for autonomous robotic inspections and supervised teleoperations in harsh and semi-structured environments. The repository contains the entire C++ software running on the onboard controller of the robots, from sensor drivers, middleware and communication, to high-level applications. The documentation can be found [here](https://mro-dev.web.cern.ch/ci/mro/robotics/cernroboticframework/cpproboticframework/html/).
