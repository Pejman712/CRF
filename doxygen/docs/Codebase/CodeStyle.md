# Code Style {#code_style}

Every major project has its own style guide, a set of conventions (sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is consistent. The Style, also known as readability, is what we call the conventions that govern our code. These conventions cover far more than just source file formatting, from “use camelCase for variable names” to “never use global variables” to “never use exceptions”.

In C++ we use the [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html), but be aware that something are not follow exactly, for example, variables are indeed written in camelCase, not in snake_case.
