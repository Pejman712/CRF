/**
 * Class for communication with Siemens PLC controllers using S5 FetchWrite protocol
 * over TCP/IP
 *
 * Basic features:
 *  - connect/disconnect to/from PLC on the given IP and port; usually FETCH operations
 *      are executed on port 2000, and WRITE operations on port 2001
 *  - FETCH data of the given Length from the given DataBlock and Address
 *  - WRITE data of the given Length to the given DataBlock and Address
 *
 * Arguments for both FETCH and WRITE operations are specified in the FetchWritePacket,
 * therefore valid FetchWritePacket should always be passed to both send and receive operations
 *
 * Note: Siemens PLC endianness (Big Endian) is different than endianness of most modern PC
 * stations (Little Endian). Take it into consideration when interpreting numerical values
 * that are bigger than 1 byte.
