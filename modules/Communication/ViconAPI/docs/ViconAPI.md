### Introduction

The [Vicon DataStream Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://www.vicon.com/software/datastream-sdk/) allows easy programmable access to the information contained in the Vicon DataStream. The function calls within the SDK enables users to connect to and request data from the Vicon DataStream.

ViconAPI module is the wrapper on the Vicon DataStream Software Development Kit (SDK), so to expose all the
functions of the SDK to the user. It is mainly used in order to mock the Vicon functions for the tests.

Please note that it was decided not to display all the functions available in the SDK but only a restricted set of them. In particular the functions belongs to "Client Class" of the DataStream SDK.
