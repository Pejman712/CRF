    /**
     * @brief There are three modes that the SDK can operate in. Each mode has a different
     *        impact on the Client, Server, and network resources used.
     *        + **ServerPush**
     *        In "ServerPush" mode, the Server pushes every new frame of data over the network
     *        to the Client. The Server will try not to drop any frames.
     *        This results in the lowest latency that can be achieved.
     *        If the Client is unable to read data at the rate it is being sent, then it is
     *        buffered, firstly in the Client, then on the TCP/IP connection, and then at the
     *        Server. When all the buffers are full then frames may be dropped at the Server and
     *        the performance of the Server may be affected. The GetFrame() method returns the most
     *        recently received frame if available, or blocks the calling thread if the most
     *        recently received frame has already been processed.
     *
     *        + **ClientPull**
     *        In "ClientPull" mode, the Client waits for a call to GetFrame(), and then requests
     *        the latest frame of data from the Server. This increases latency, because a request
     *        must be sent over the network to the Server, the Server has to prepare the frame
     *        of data for the Client, and then the data must be sent back over the network.
     *        Network bandwidth is kept to a minimum, because the Server only sends what you need.
     *        The buffers are very unlikely to be filled, and Server performance is unlikely to be
     *        affected. The GetFrame() method blocks the calling thread until the frame has been
     *        received.
     *
     *        + **ClientPullPreFetch**
     *        "ClientPullPreFetch" is an enhancement to the "ClientPull" mode.
     *        As soon as a sample has been received, it will preemptively request the next sample.
     *        The server will send you this next sample as soon as it is ready, so do not
     *        experience the delay in requesting it. GetFrame() may block the calling thread if
     *        the next frame has not been received yet.
     *        As with normal "ClientPull", buffers are unlikely to fill up, and Server performance
     *        is unlikely to be affected.
     *
     *        The stream defaults to "ClientPull" mode as this is considered the easiest option.
     *        For improved performance use "ServerPush". "ClientPullPreFetch" may be useful if
     *        problems are being caused by large numbers of samples being buffered.
     * @param Mode Stream modes that the SDK can operate in
