# Fourier Transform {#fourier_transform}

FftProcessing module uses EigenFft library to extend a bit its functionality:

1. Added Zero-Padding feature.
2. Added windowing feature.

At the time of module development (15.08.2020) there were no C++ libraries identified, that include these features. If someone finds it, then this module will become redundant.
