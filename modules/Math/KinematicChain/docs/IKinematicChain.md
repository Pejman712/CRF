@ingroup group_i_kinematic_chain

### Functionality

The functionality of this interface is to provide geometrical data of the kinematic chain
dependent on joint positions,
such as:
    - axes of the joints
    - translations between intertial frame, joints and the end effector
    - rotations between intertial frame, joints and the end effector

### Conventions

Joints are numberred from 0.
