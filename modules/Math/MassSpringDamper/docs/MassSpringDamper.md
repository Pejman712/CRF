@ingroup group_mass_spring_damper
The Mass Spring Damper module, as its name indicates, emulate the behaviour of a Mass Spring Damper System. In general, the system receives as an input the force applied and calculates the displacement.

Depending on the number of dimensions considered, we have diferent implementations for one dimension (IMassSpringDamperR1) and N dimensions (IMassSpringDamperRn).
