### Introduction

An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is a sensor module that combines multiple inertial sensors to provide accurate and real-time information about an object's movement in three-dimensional space. The key components of an IMU include:

- Accelerometer: Measures linear acceleration along the three axes to detect changes in velocity and determine the object's orientation relative to gravity.

- Gyroscope: Measures the rate of rotation around each axis, providing data on angular velocity and helping to track the object's angular position.

- Magnetometer: Measures the strength and direction of the ambient magnetic field, aiding in determining the object's orientation with respect to the Earth's magnetic north.

IMUs contribute to precise control, movement planning, and enhanced user experiences. Calibration is often necessary to ensure the accuracy of sensor data, and ongoing advancements in technology lead to improvements in sensor accuracy, reduced power consumption, and miniaturization of IMU modules. Overall, IMUs play a crucial role in motion sensing and navigation, enabling innovation across a wide range of devices and applications.
