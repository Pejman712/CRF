### Introduction
Motion capture (sometimes referred as mo-cap or mocap, for short) is the process of recording the movement of objects or people. It is used in military, entertainment, sports, medical applications, and for validation of computer vision and robots. When it includes face and fingers or captures subtle expressions, it is often referred to as performance capture. In many fields, motion capture is sometimes called motion tracking.

There are many different approaches to motion capture.
- Optical-Passive. This technique uses retroreflective markers that are tracked by infrared cameras. It is the most flexible and common method used in the industry.
- Optical-Active. This technique uses LED markers that emit light that are tracked by special cameras. Because of this they need a battery or charger of some kind.
- Video/Markerless. This technique does not require markers and instead relies on software to track the subjectsâ€™ movement. Varying tracking methods yield different results, but real-time and final data error ranges tend to be larger than marker-based solutions.
- Inertial. This technique does not require cameras except as a localization tool. Inertial sensors (sometimes known as IMUs) are worn by the subject and the data from the sensors is transmitted wirelessly to a computer or smart device.

Passive optical motion capture is the most accurate, flexible and common type of motion capture.
